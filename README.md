# Portfolio v2.0

Building upon my current portfolio hosted on Wordpress (v1.0), this version aims to be a front-end portfolio developed solely using TypeScript and React while using the current Wordpress infrastructure for backend and content management (since I'm too lazy to build my own).

## Ideas:

**Home page**:

- Full screen, divided into two vertical sections (60-40 ratio).
- Left side: Retain the 'hello' part of the portfolio but make it a bit fancier.
  - Auto carousel of 'hello' in languages that I can speak (English, Vietnamese, German).
  - Name lights up like it's a neon adboard?
  - Potential CTA buttons (max 2).
- Right side: Slideshow for different types of past work/projects that links to their respective category page.

**Nav bar**:

- Potentially burger nav bar on the right side of the screen.
